# How to verify VoicERA is working

For operators and programme managers after deployment.

## Before any phone call

| Check | What to do | Good sign | Bad sign |
|-------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Dashboard loads | Open site in browser | Login or home page | Blank page, connection error |
| Can log in | Use provided account | Dashboard home | Error or login loop |
| Backend alive | Partner: `GET /health` or container logs | Healthy response | 502/503, container stopped |
| Voice server alive | Partner: `/health` on voice port | Healthy response | Crash loop |

## Test without a phone (do this first)

| Step | Good sign |
|------|-----------|
| Go to **Assistants** | List loads or empty with create button |
| Click **Test on Browser** | Dialog opens |
| Allow microphone | Mic enabled |
| Wait a few seconds | Connected / active session UI |
| Speak | Agent responds with voice |
| End test | Dialog closes cleanly |

If this fails, the issue is usually [public voice URLs](../deployment/public-voice-urls.md), **Integrations** AI keys, or network — not telephony. See [FAQ](faq.md).

## Test with a phone call

| Step | Good sign |
|------|-----------|
| **Integrations** has Vobiz credentials | Saved successfully |
| Number linked to agent | Shows agent name on Numbers page |
| Call the number | Hear agent greeting |
| After hangup | New row in **Meetings** |
| Recording (if enabled) | Play or download available |

## Healthy system (summary)

- Dashboard loads without error banners
- **Test on Browser** works
- Real calls appear in **Meetings** with reasonable duration
- Agents save without errors

## What to report when something fails

1. Date and time
2. Agent name or ID
3. Phone number used (if applicable)
4. Screenshot of any dashboard error
5. Whether **Test on Browser** worked (yes/no)

Hosting partner log commands:

```bash
docker compose logs -f backend
docker compose logs -f voice_server
docker compose logs -f frontend
```
