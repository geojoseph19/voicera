# Welcome to VoicEra

**VoicEra** is an open-source voice AI platform for building real-time conversational phone agents in Indian languages. It bundles speech-to-text, large language models, text-to-speech, and telephony into a single stack you can self-host.

Use VoicEra to run inbound helplines, outbound campaigns, IVR replacements, and citizen-services hotlines — without writing voice infrastructure from scratch.

## What you get

| Capability | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Real-time voice agents** | Sub-second STT → LLM → TTS loop powered by [Pipecat](concepts/voice-pipeline.md). |
| **Indian-language support** | Local STT/TTS via [AI4Bharat](services/ai4bharat-stt.md) servers or hosted providers. |
| **Telephony integration** | Inbound and outbound calls through [Vobiz](concepts/telephony-model.md) over WebSocket. |
| **Knowledge base (RAG)** | Ground answers in your own PDFs and documents. See [Knowledge base](concepts/knowledge-base-rag.md). |
| **Web dashboard** | Configure agents, link numbers, run campaigns, review transcripts and recordings. |
| **Self-hosted** | Docker Compose stack. Your data, your servers, your model keys. |
