# Brief: How do I know it's working? (B6)

**Review gap:** No section describing what a non-technical operator should see when the system is healthy.

**Audience:** Operators and programme managers.

## After deployment (no phone call yet)

| Check | What to do | Good sign | Bad sign |
|-------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Dashboard loads | Open website in browser | Login page or home after login | Blank page, connection error |
| Can log in | Use provided account | Dashboard home visible | Error message, loop back to login |
| Backend alive | Hosting partner: open `/health` or check logs | Healthy response | 502/503, container stopped |
| Voice server alive | Hosting partner: `/health` on voice port | Healthy response | Container crash loop |

---

## Test without a phone (recommended first)

| Step | Good sign |
|------|-----------|
| Go to **Assistants** | List of agents (or empty list with create button) |
| Click **Test on Browser** on an agent | Dialog opens |
| Allow microphone when browser asks | Mic enabled |
| Wait a few seconds | Connected state; orb or UI shows active session |
| Speak | Agent responds with voice |
| End test | Dialog closes cleanly |

**If this fails:** Problem is likely voice server URL, Integrations AI keys, or network — not telephony. See B8 FAQ.

## Test with a phone call

| Step | Good sign |
|------|-----------|
| Integrations has Vobiz/Plivo credentials | Saved successfully |
| Number linked to agent on Numbers page | Shows agent name |
| Call the number from mobile | Call connects; hear agent greeting |
| After hangup | New row in **Meetings/calls** with time and status |
| Recording (if enabled) | Can play or download from dashboard or storage |

---

## What "healthy" looks like on screen (summary)

- Dashboard loads quickly, no red error banners
- **Test on Browser** connects and you hear the agent
- After a real call, **Meetings** shows the call with reasonable duration
- Operators can create and save agents without errors

---

## What to report if something fails

Give hosting partner:

1. Date and time of test
2. Agent name or ID
3. Phone number used (if applicable)
4. Screenshot of dashboard error (if any)
5. Whether Test on Browser worked (yes/no)

Partner checks logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f backend
docker compose logs -f voice_server
docker compose logs -f frontend
```
